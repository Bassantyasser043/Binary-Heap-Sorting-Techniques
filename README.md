# Heap_Binary-search-and-sorting-techniques
## Problem Statement (first Requirement):
- In this assignment, youâ€™re required to implement some basic procedures and show how they could be used in a sorting algorithm: The MAX-HEAPIFY procedure which runs in <b> O(lg n) </b> time, is the key to maintaining the max-heap property. The BUILD-MAX-HEAP procedure, which runs in linear time, produces a max-heap from an unordered input array.

- The HEAPSORT procedure, which run sin O(nlgn) time,sorts an array inplace. The MAX-HEAP-INSERT, and HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX procedures, which run in <b> O(lg n) </b> time,allow the heap data structure to implement a priority queue.
## How to use:
1- The user has 4 choices to choose between (insert- build-compare-max-HeapSort):

1) Compare: if it is used then it means that comparing in the runtime
between heap sort- merge sort -Bubble sort and this happens randomly
as the input array is randomized.

2) Build: build a heap max from input array. Users enter only an array to
build it in a max heap.

3) Insert: take an array from the user and perform an operation like insert
but the only difference is insert build heap array while build not.

4) Max: get max element from the heap.
5) 
2- According to the user's choice, the method will be performed.
