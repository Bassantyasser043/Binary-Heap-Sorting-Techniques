# Heap_Binary-search-and-sorting-techniques
## Problem Statement (first Requirement):
- In this assignment, youâ€™re required to implement some basic procedures and show how they could be used in a sorting algorithm: The MAX-HEAPIFY procedure which runs in <b> O(lg n) </b> time, is the key to maintaining the max-heap property. The BUILD-MAX-HEAP procedure, which runs in linear time, produces a max-heap from an unordered input array.

- The HEAPSORT procedure, which run sin O(nlgn) time,sorts an array
inplace. The MAX-HEAP-INSERT, and HEAP-EXTRACT-MAX procedures,
which run in O(lg n)time,allow the heap data structure to implement a priority
queue.
